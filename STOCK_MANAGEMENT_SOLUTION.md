# Stock Management Solution - Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the complete solution for fixing critical stock management issues in the order system.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Stock Restoration on Order Cancellation ✅
**Problem**: When orders were canceled, stock was NOT restored to inventory.
**Solution**: Updated `OrderObserver` to restore stock when order status changes to CANCELED.

### 2. Stock Validation Before Approval ✅
**Problem**: Orders could be approved without checking stock availability.
**Solution**: Added stock validation in `OrderController::updateStatus()` before approving orders.

### 3. Stock Tracking and Audit Trail ✅
**Problem**: No tracking of which orders affected stock and no audit trail.
**Solution**: Added `stock_affected` flag to orders table and created `stock_movements` table for audit trail.

### 4. Centralized Stock Management ✅
**Problem**: Stock operations scattered across different controllers.
**Solution**: Created `StockService` class to centralize all stock operations.

### 5. Warning System for Pending Orders ✅
**Problem**: No warnings when updating pending orders with quantities exceeding stock.
**Solution**: Added warning system in `OrderUpdate` Livewire component.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created:
1. `database/migrations/2025_01_19_190831_add_stock_affected_to_orders_table.php`
2. `database/migrations/2025_01_19_190832_create_stock_movements_table.php`
3. `app/Services/StockService.php`
4. `app/Models/StockMovement.php`

### Files Modified:
1. `app/Models/Order.php` - Added `stock_affected` field
2. `app/Observers/OrderObserver.php` - Complete rewrite with StockService integration
3. `app/Http/Controllers/Order/OrderController.php` - Added stock validation and StockService usage
4. `app/Livewire/OrderUpdate.php` - Added stock warning system

## Database Changes

### Orders Table
```sql
ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN stock_affected BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
```

### Stock Movements Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE stock_movements (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    product_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    order_id BIGINT NULL,
    movement_type ENUM('deducted', 'restored', 'adjusted', 'refilled'),
    quantity INT NOT NULL,
    balance_after INT NOT NULL,
    reason VARCHAR(255),
    user_id BIGINT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## How It Works Now

### Order Creation (PENDING Status)
- Order created with `stock_affected = false`
- Stock is NOT deducted
- Items can be updated freely

### Order Approval
1. System validates stock availability for all items
2. If insufficient stock → approval blocked with error message
3. If stock available → stock deducted and `stock_affected = true`
4. All movements logged in `stock_movements` table

### Order Cancellation
1. If `stock_affected = true` → stock restored to products
2. `stock_affected` set to `false`
3. Restoration logged in `stock_movements` table

### Order Deletion
1. If `stock_affected = true` → stock restored to products
2. Order deleted from database
3. Restoration logged in `stock_movements` table

### Order Updates (Pending Only)
- Warning shown if quantities exceed available stock
- No stock affected until approval

## Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Order Approval with Sufficient Stock
1. Create order with products (status: PENDING)
2. Approve order
3. ✅ Stock should be deducted
4. ✅ `stock_affected` should be `true`
5. ✅ Movement logged in `stock_movements`

### Test 2: Order Approval with Insufficient Stock
1. Create order with quantity > available stock
2. Try to approve order
3. ✅ Should show error message
4. ✅ Order remains PENDING
5. ✅ No stock deducted

### Test 3: Order Cancellation After Approval
1. Create and approve order (stock deducted)
2. Cancel the order
3. ✅ Stock should be restored
4. ✅ `stock_affected` should be `false`
5. ✅ Restoration logged in `stock_movements`

### Test 4: Order Deletion After Approval
1. Create and approve order (stock deducted)
2. Delete the order
3. ✅ Stock should be restored
4. ✅ Order deleted from database
5. ✅ Restoration logged in `stock_movements`

### Test 5: Pending Order Updates
1. Create order (PENDING)
2. Update item quantity > available stock
3. ✅ Warning message should appear
4. ✅ Update should still be allowed
5. ✅ No stock affected yet

## Migration Instructions

1. **Run Migrations**:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

2. **Update Existing Orders** (Optional):
   If you have existing approved orders, you may want to set their `stock_affected` flag:
   ```sql
   UPDATE orders SET stock_affected = true WHERE order_status = 1;
   ```

## StockService Methods

### `deductStockForOrder(Order $order): bool`
- Deducts stock for all items in an order
- Marks order as `stock_affected = true`
- Logs all movements

### `restoreStockForOrder(Order $order): bool`
- Restores stock for all items in an order
- Marks order as `stock_affected = false`
- Logs all movements

### `canApproveOrder(Order $order): array`
- Checks if order can be approved
- Returns array with `can_approve` boolean and `issues` array

### `getStockHistory(int $productId, int $limit = 50)`
- Returns stock movement history for a product
- Useful for debugging and reporting

## Error Handling

- All stock operations are wrapped in database transactions
- Failures are logged but don't break the order flow
- User-friendly error messages for insufficient stock
- Detailed logging for debugging

## Performance Considerations

- Stock movements table will grow over time
- Consider archiving old movements periodically
- Index on `product_id` and `created_at` for performance
- Index on `order_id` and `movement_type` for queries

## Future Enhancements

1. **Stock Reservation System**: Reserve stock for pending orders
2. **Batch Operations**: Handle multiple orders efficiently
3. **Stock Alerts**: Notify when products are low
4. **Reporting Dashboard**: Stock movement analytics
5. **API Endpoints**: Expose stock management via API

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Stock not being deducted on approval
- Check if OrderObserver is registered
- Verify StockService is properly injected
- Check logs for any errors

### Issue: Stock not being restored on cancellation
- Verify order has `stock_affected = true`
- Check if products still exist in database
- Review stock_movements table for logs

### Issue: Approval blocked incorrectly
- Check current product quantities
- Verify order item quantities
- Review StockService::canApproveOrder logic

## Monitoring

Monitor these metrics:
- Orders with `stock_affected = true` but status != APPROVED
- Stock movements without corresponding orders
- Products with negative quantities
- Failed stock operations in logs
